1. e4 {Notes by Richard Reti} 1... e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Be7 5. e5 Nfd7
6. h4 {This ingenious method of play which has subsequently been adopted by all
modern masters is characteristic of Alekhine’s style.} 6... Bxg5 7. hxg5 Qxg5
8. Nh3 {! The short-stepping knight is always brought as near as possible to
the actual battle field. Therefore White does not make the plausible move 8 Nf3
but 8 Nh3 so as to get the knight to f4.} 8... Qe7 9. Nf4 Nf8 10. Qg4 f5 {The
only move. Not only was 11 Qxg7 threatened but also Nxd5.} 11. exf6 gxf6 12.
O-O-O {He again threatens Nxd5.} 12... c6 13. Re1 Kd8 14. Rh6 e5 15. Qh4 Nbd7
16. Bd3 e4 17. Qg3 Qf7 {Forced - the sacrifice of the knight at d5 was
threatened and after 17...Qd6 18 Bxe4 dxe4 19 Rxe4 and 20 Qg7 wins.} 18. Bxe4
dxe4 19. Nxe4 Rg8 20. Qa3 {Here, as so often happens, a surprising move and one
difficult to have foreseen, forms the kernel of an apparently simple Alekhine
combination.} 20... Qg7 {After 20.Qe7 21.Qa5+ b6 22.Qc3 would follow.} 21.
Nd6 Nb6 22. Ne8 Qf7 {White mates in three moves.} 23. Qd6+ 1-0
